'''
Script to be used after a bunch of runs have been made,
making some plots that could be useful for the thesis.

Ideas:
    plot a matrix of a single strategy in heatmap/grayscale with strength
        - actually 2: 1 for the dealer, 1 for the pone
    plot a time-stretch of matrices of a single strategy in grayscale/heatmap
        as time progresses for

This can be left for later
